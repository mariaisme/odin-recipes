        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want fluffier and eggier eggs, use water.<br>
                Using milk will make your eggs taste less eggy and fluffy, but will make it taste creamier.</li>
            <li>The heat of the pan depends on your preference.<br>
                Cooking Low and Slow will make it more runny.<br>
                Cooking Fast and Quick will make it more defined.</li>
            <li>You can use as much eggs as you want.<br>
                Add a tablespoon of water or milk for each egg added.</li>
            <li>You can use butter instead of oil for a richer flavor.</li>
        </ul>
