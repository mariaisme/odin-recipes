                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want your egg more toasty, add more oil.<br> 
                        Once you crack your egg, use a spoon to spoon the hot oil on top of the egg</li>
                    <li>You can use as much eggs as you want.<br>
                        But do consider talking to your doctor or physician about how much you can eat per day.</li>
                    <li>For seasonings, you can go for the classic salt and pepper.<br>
                        But don't let that limit your tastes.<br>
                        Consider trying other spices such as chili powder or a dash of nori flakes.</li>
