# odin-recipes
Assignment for this tutorial: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

With this project, I will be listing recipes I've written down my notebook to memorialize them in the web space.

I will be adding images from google, with the hopes that later on I'd be uploading my own.
Images taken from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggs_as_food

Will update this project in a week.
